# laila-hangman
A fun Hangman game for my seven years old Daughter Laila 

 - A random phrase is hidden on screen

 - Guess letters to figure out the phrase
 
 - Five wrong guesses ends the game as a los
 
 - Guess and enter the entire phrase to win
 
 - Phrases are randomized to prevent duplicates(Though it is possible that the last phrase in a cycle could be the same as the first phrase in the next cycle, though the likely hood of that decreases as the number of possible phrases increases.)
 
 Dedicated to my Laila-Bug, the cutest thing in the universe! <3
